## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and launch the project locally.

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v16.x or higher) â€“ [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (npm comes with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- A **Git** client â€“ [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

## **Important Notes**

### **Testing Information**

For testing purposes, the following household data has been pre-populated in the database:

- **Household ID:** 1 | **PIN Code:** 1111  
- **Household ID:** 2 | **PIN Code:** 2222  
- **Household ID:** 3 | **PIN Code:** 3333

### **1. Clone the Repository**
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emperaspera/sshSharedOrdering.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd sshSharedOrdering
```

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install the required dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:
```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

---

### **3. Configure Database**

#### **Step 1: Modify `initDatabase.js`**
- Open the `initDatabase.js` file.
- Update the `DB_CONFIG` object with your PostgreSQL credentials:
  ```javascript
  const DB_CONFIG = {
      user: "your_username",        // Your PostgreSQL username
      host: "localhost",            // Hostname
      password: "your_password",    // Your PostgreSQL password
      port: 5432,                   // Default port
      defaultDatabase: "postgres",  // Default "postgres" database
      targetDatabase: "ssh",        // Target database to create
  };
  ```

#### **Step 2: Run `initDatabase.js` to Create the Database and Schema**
Run the following command to execute the database initialization script:
```bash
node initDatabase.js
```

This script will:
1. Create the `ssh` database if it doesn't exist.
2. Initialize the required tables and schema.
3. Populate the database with test household data.

---

### **4. Start the Server**
Once the database is set up, start the backend server by running:
```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server, and it will be accessible at:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```

---

### **5. Start the Frontend Development Server**
Run the following command to start the React application:
```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server. Open your browser and navigate to the link provided in the terminal, typically:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
